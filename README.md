# Hi, my name is Darcy Power.

I'm a self-taught software developer from Australia

## Interests

I'm currently learning the ins and outs of web-development, 
focusing on learning the Vue 3 framework, MySQL, and Git.

I also have an interest in C++.
I plan to learn the GLFW library with the intention of creating a simple 2D game engine
mainly as a way to hone my skill set, but also because I have an interest in game development.
