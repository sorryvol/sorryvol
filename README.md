# Hi, my name is Darcy Power.

I'm a self-taught full stack software engineer from Australia.

## Full-Stack Development
I'm am constantly learning and improving my skills by working on different projects. I excel more at backend programming than frontend but can make a well designed website if needed, I have a plethora of 'non software engineer' skills which can assist me in making websites and applications looks better such as: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Blender/3D modelling and more.

My stack of choice is the MERN stack.

- M - MySQL (or MongoDB if it is more suited to the project)
- E - Express.js
- R - React.js
- N - Node.js


## C++
I am also well versed in C++ and am able to incorporate it into projects when needed, it is my language of choice when not working on websites.
